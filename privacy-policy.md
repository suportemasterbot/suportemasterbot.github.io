## Application

ShareX does not collect any data of any kind, including personally identifiable information. 

ShareX only sends files (images, text, video, etc.) selected or captured by the user to third party services which the user chooses themselves to configure. Prior to its very first upload, ShareX provides a warning with a five-second auto-pause delay timer to ensure the user is attentive while requesting confirmation of the upload.

ShareX checks for updates at startup, and also between intervals using GitHub API and downloads the updates from GitHub when the user permits it.

ShareX implements YouTube API Services to support uploading videos to YouTube. You may wish to read the Privacy Policy of third party services we currently use:
